Essay Questions
Q1: Edge AI vs. Cloud AI
Definition: Edge AI means AI processing is done locally on devices like smartphones, cameras, or drones.

Reduces Latency: Since data doesn't need to travel to the cloud, processing is faster — critical in real-time tasks like obstacle avoidance in drones.

Enhances Privacy: Data stays on the device, reducing exposure risk (e.g., face recognition in security cams without uploading data).

Example: Autonomous drones process video in real-time to avoid collisions — no internet delay.

Q2: Quantum AI vs. Classical AI
Classical AI: Solves optimization using brute force or heuristics.

Quantum AI: Uses quantum bits and parallelism to explore many states at once — exponentially faster for complex problems.

Industries:

Logistics (route optimization)

Finance (portfolio optimization)

Pharma (molecule simulation)

Energy (smart grid efficiency)

Q3: Human-AI in Healthcare
Radiologists: AI can pre-screen X-rays or MRIs, highlighting anomalies for human confirmation — faster diagnosis, reduced workload.

Nurses: AI tools can monitor vitals and alert nurses before crises.

Impact: Enhances efficiency, but may shift roles to more analytical/managerial rather than manual.

Case Study Critique: AI in Smart Cities
Topic: AI-IoT for Traffic Management
Integration Benefits:

Real-time traffic light control = less congestion

Pollution reduction via optimized flows

Data from sensors help long-term planning

Challenges:

Data security – traffic cams and sensors collect sensitive data.

Interoperability – integrating many systems (from different vendors) is complex.
